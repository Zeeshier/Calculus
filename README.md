# Calculus for Machine Learning and Data Science
Welcome to the Calculus for Machine Learning and Data Science repository! This project is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of calculus concepts essential for applications in machine learning and data science.

## Introduction
Calculus forms the mathematical backbone of many machine learning and data science algorithms. A solid grasp of calculus enables practitioners to develop, optimize, and understand complex models and algorithms. This repository offers a curated collection of resources, including lecture notes, Jupyter notebooks, and practical examples, to facilitate learning and application of calculus in these fields.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into the following sections:

1. **[Derivatives & Optimization](https://github.com/Zeeshier/Calculus/tree/main/01.%20Derivatives%20%26%20Optimization)**: Fundamentals of derivatives and their role in optimizing machine learning models.

2. **[Gradient and Gradient Descent](https://github.com/Zeeshier/Calculus/tree/main/02.%20Gradient%20and%20Gradient%20Descent)**: Understanding gradients and implementing gradient descent algorithms.

3. **[Optimization in Neural Networks](https://github.com/Zeeshier/Calculus/tree/main/03.%20Optimization%20in%20Neural%20Networks)**: Application of calculus in training and optimizing neural network models.
  
4. **[Newton's Method](https://github.com/Zeeshier/Calculus/tree/main/04.%20Newton's%20Method)**: Exploration of Newton's Method for finding successively better approximations to the roots of a real-valued function.

## Each section contains:

**Lecture Notes:** Detailed explanations of key concepts.

**Jupyter Notebooks:** Interactive notebooks with examples and exercises.

**Assignments:** Practice problems to test and enhance your understanding.
